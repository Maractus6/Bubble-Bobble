DIRECTIONS:
press start to start game
press select to go to pause during games
arrow keys for movement
button a to create a bubble
collide with a trapped enemy to turn it into food
collide with food to score a point

GOAL:
beat the 2 rounds to win
lose all 3 hearts and you lose

Note:
the food is implemented, but the collision is happening too fast and thus cannot be seen :(
enemy 2 is on the 2nd level and its a ghost that isn't supposed to move until the timer runs down
enemy 2 is not colliding well with player, very iffy on if it works. it does get trapped however (if you change score to 12 for win condition on game2, you can see the win screen tho :thumbsup:)
